1.Numpy

    It is a fundammental library designed for numerical computing which provides support for large and multidimensional matrices with
    a collection of mathematical functions to operate on arrays (collection of numbers)

2.Pandas

   Pandas is a open source library for data manipulation and analysis in python.It is a tool in python which help us to wor with data 
   in a table like format.It helps to organize data in rows and columns and analyze and manipulate the organized data quickly and efficiently

3.Tensorflow

   Tensorflow is a framework developed by google that helps us to build and train machine learning models. It is a tool for making and training
   models that can analyze and predict from data and making predictions.

4.Keras

   Keras is a tool in python that helps you build and train models to make predictions.It is like a helpful assistant which makes it easier to 
   create powerful machine learning models. 

5.Scikit-learn   

   Scikit-learn (sklearn) is a powerful, open-source Python library used for machine learning. It provides simple and efficient tools for 
   data analysis, including algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction.

6.Pytorch    

   PyTorch is a open-source deep learning library that makes it easy to create and train neural networks. It was developed by Facebook 
   which allows you to work with tensors (like multi-dimensional arrays) and provides automatic differentiation.
